// Here we have a stack of homework assignments represented as an array: "BIO12" is at the base, and "PSY44" is at the top of the stack.

// Modify the given array and treat it like a stack using the JavaScript methods mentioned above. Remove the top element "PSY44" from the stack. Then add "CS50" to be the new top element of the stack.

var homeworkStack = ["BIO12","HIS80","MAT122","PSY44"];
// Only change code below this line

homeworkStack.pop();
